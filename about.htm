		Matt Bowden is a Nashville based recording engineer and producer.  Specializing in the genre of metal and audio post production, 
		he was worked with several up and coming independent metal acts, as well as renowned metal producer Josh Travis of 
		The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza and Glass Cloud.  A graduate of the Art Institute of Tennessee-Nashville, 
		he studied audio production with concentration in sound design and post production for video games and film.  
		<BR><BR>
		Matt found his way into the production of audio after playing in several small touring bands in the early 2000's.  
		During that time, he lived in Seattle, WA with engineer/sound designer Brad Spear (Sound Designer/Composer for
		<i>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Blackbox Entertainment, PS2</i>) - affording him
		the opportunity to see first hand how the industry works, as well as spend some time in a professional recording environment.  Upon returning home
		to Nashville, TN, Matt began his studies in the field of audio production at the Art Institute of Tennssee - Nashville and quickly moved into
		freelance work as a student.
		<BR><BR>
		In 2009, he was invited to work with The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza during the production of their third studio release, <i>Danza III:
		The Series of Unfortunate Events (Black Market Activities)</i>.  During that time he conducted several interviews with the band members, and created
		the album artwork reveal for the album, to generate buzz for the release.  Matt was also in the works to produce and direct a music video for the band's
		single W.A.L.L.S. from the album - though the project never made it beyond the preproduction phase.
		<br><BR>
		Currently Matt is working closely with the band Stay, Still to release their first studio album by Q1 2014.  He has taken on the 
		responsibilities of producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer, and mastering engineer, as well as playing on the upcoming album.  
		Production is scheduled to be completed in the latter half of December 2013 in Tallahassee, Florida where Josh Travis of 
		Glass Cloud will be assisting in the mixing and mastering processes. 
		<BR><BR>
		Outside of music, Matt also has a great love for the art and business of video games.  He is the Co-Founder of <a href="http://gamestitch.com" target="_blank">GameStitch.com</a>,
		a website dedicated to the latest news and trends in gaming, as well as a resource for reviews and gaming incite.  There, he co-hosts a weekly podcast with Founder
		Ryan Walton and Senior Editor Daniel Reamer, presented in a "week in review" format.  The website is growing monthly, and a small cult following in the Nashville
		area has formed in support of the effort.  Wizard World also sponsored the GameStitch crew to attend the first annual Nashville Comic-Con in 2013 as members of the
		media/press to cover the event for the local fan base.<BR><BR>
